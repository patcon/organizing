        - changes: clarify what it IS/ISN'T. reduce basis for disputes.
    - doesn't change our dates.
    - dc: in next couples months: key deliverables for ourselves. more after. proceed cautiously with diligence.
    - uv: process for new collective? submit. we "do due diligence". click accept. lots of black box tbd rn.
